# Jupyter Notebooks Demo
This project demonstrates how you can analyze datasets using Jupyter Notebooks, pandas and matplotlib. It later demonstrates other Data Analysis concepts such as data cleaning.
## Prerequisites
To run the Jupyter notebooks in this project, you'll need the following:
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas
* matplotlib
## Project Structure
The first part of this project consists of a single Jupyter Notebooks file: demo_book.ipynb. This is where you should start.

Later, you can move to test.book.ipnb notebook to see some advanced features of data visualisations with matplotlib.

Last part, contains python scripts used for data cleaning with an accompanying clean_book.ipynb.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository
```shell

```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository
```shell
cd Jupyter_Notebook_Demo
```
3. Start Jupyter Notebook
```shell
jupyter notebook
```

## Credits
Parts of this project have been based on Real Python courses on data analysis. Their content is highly recommended.
